Wearable Air Quality and Physiology Module files


This is a repository for the Wearable Air Quality Monitoring Project for Personal Exposure. In this implementation, two wearable modules are designed, such as the Air Quality Module and the Physiology Module, using SeeedStudio XIAO nRF52840 microcontroller. Relevant air quality and physiology data is transmitted to a mobile application via BLE.

Each folder has its own Readme file to go in depth on the documentation of each wearable module.
